# Ecommerce-RFV-Clustering
This project utilizes clustering techniques to segment customers for an e-commerce platform, optimizing marketing campaigns by identifying patterns in purchasing behavior.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and group them into clusters based on their purchasing patterns. By identifying clusters with similar characteristics, the company can tailor marketing strategies to target specific customer segments effectively.

## Context

Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail".

Content
"This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers."

## Data

The dataset comprises transactional data from an e-commerce store across 38 countries and territories, featuring over 4,000 unique customers and 540,000 transactions. Preprocessing steps include handling null values and treating non-numeric identifiers appropriately.

## Approach

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Visualize distributions and identify the relevance of columns for analysis.
    - Check for missing data, duplicates, outliers, and other inconsistencies.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Normalize the data.
    - Select the most relevant variables for the model.
    - Remove null values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3. **Select a Clustering Algorithm**
    - Choose a suitable algorithm for the dataset, such as K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, or Mean Shift.
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters using Elbow or Silhouette Score methods.
    - Implement the selected algorithm.

4. **Analyze the Obtained Clusters**
    - Identify patterns and common characteristics among customers.
    - Plot graphs to assist in the analysis.

5. **Interpretation of Results**
    - Describe the purchasing profile of customers in each cluster.
    - Justify how this analysis can be useful for the company to segment its customers and personalize marketing campaigns.
    - Propose possible actions based on the insights obtained.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Organization and Readability of the Code
- Justification of Decision Making
- Quality of Exploratory Analysis (comprehensive and detailed analysis, showing correlations and insights)
- Quality of Cluster Analysis (well-defined and interpretable clusters)
- Presentation of a coherent proposal with the clusters (suggesting actions that can be taken to improve the e-commerce performance)
